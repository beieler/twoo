The party demanding arbitration will propose  an ADR Provider and the other party shall not unreasonably withhold consent to  use such ADR Provider.

Each party shall bear its own  costs (including attorney fees) and disbursements arising out of the  arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR  Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, The Wisdom Of Others may seek  injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property  rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. Please note that the laws of the  jurisdiction where you are located may be different from Colorado law,  including the laws governing what can be legally sold, bought, exported,  offered or imported.
